# Diabetes-Prediction-Based-On-Diagnostic-Measures
Aim / Objective:
The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. The data was collected and made available by “National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases” as part of the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here belong to the Pima Indian heritage (subgroup of Native Americans), and are females of ages 21 and above.We’ll be using Python and some of its popular data science related packages.
